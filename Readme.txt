Lagom Readme file
-----------------

Lagom requires the newest version of Direct3D 9 to run,
this is available at:

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35

all sourcecode including the uncompressed data files can be found at:

https://github.com/jaschmid/Lagom

note that the source is not necessarily made to be built easily,
you'll definately have to make your own project files to build it.

This project was never really meant as something to be shared, it was developed in 1 month, so a lot of shortcuts had to be taken.

I'm experimenting with an android port right now, but currently for various reason's it's nonfunctional (not the least of which is that there's no cg on android). So don't let yourself be fooled by all the android files into thinking that you can build an android package that works.

A binary version of the whole package is available at:
